                    Nepal,[a] officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal,[b] is a landlocked country in South
                    Asia. It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It
                    borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India to the south, east, and west,
                    while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the
                    Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested
                    hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on
                    Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and its largest city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic,
                    multi-lingual, multi-religious, and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language.

                    The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the
                    era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the
                    middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in
                    southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. The centrally
                    located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the
                    prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road
                    was dominated by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art
                    and architecture. By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The
                    Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire,
                    under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state
                    between Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 but was
                    twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and
                    early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the world's last
                    Hindu monarchy.

                    The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a federal parliamentary republic
                    divided into seven provinces. Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship
                    treaties were signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of
                    the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which it is a founding member.
                    Nepal is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative.</p>

                    Ancient Nepal

                    This painting in a Laotian temple depicts a legend surrounding the birth of Gautama Buddha c. 563 BC
                    in Lumbini, Western Nepal.
                    By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa,
                    where they had earlier evolved.[30][31][32] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia
                    date to about 30,000 years ago.[33] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human
                    settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time.[34]

                    After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent
                    structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now
                    Balochistan.[35] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[36][35] the first
                    urban culture in South Asia.[37] Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins
                    have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of Dang district.[38] The earliest inhabitants of modern
                    Nepal and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the Indus Valley Civilisation. It is
                    possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian
                    subcontinent (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the
                    Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across the border.[39] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had
                    reached Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or
                    both.[40] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians,
                    who were in Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the
                    valley of Kathmandu.[41]


                    In the premises of the Changu Narayan Temple is a stone inscription dated 464 AD, the first in Nepal
                    since the Ashoka inscription of Lumbini (c. 250 BC).
                    By the late Vedic period, Nepal was being mentioned in various Hindu texts, such as the late Vedic
                    Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa and in the post-Vedic Atharvashirsha Upanishad.[42] The Gopal Bansa was the
                    oldest dynasty to be mentioned in various texts as the earliest rulers of the central Himalayan
                    kingdom known by the name 'Nepal'.[43] The Gopalas were followed by Kiratas who ruled for over 16
                    centuries by some accounts.[44] According to the Mahabharata, the then Kirata king went to take part
                    in the Battle of Kurukshetra. In the south-eastern region, Janakpurdham was the capital of the
                    prosperous kingdom of Videha or Mithila, that extended down to the Ganges, and home to King Janaka
                    and his daughter, Sita.

                    Around 600 BC, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of Nepal.
                    From one of these, the Shakya polity, arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an
                    ascetic life, founded Buddhism, and came to be known as Gautama Buddha (traditionally dated 563–483
                    BC).[45] Nepal came to be established as a land of spirituality and refuge in the intervening
                    centuries, played an important role in transmitting Buddhism to East Asia via Tibet,[46] and helped
                    preserve Hindu and Buddhist manuscripts.

                    By 250 BC, the southern regions had come under the influence of the Maurya Empire. Emperor Ashoka
                    made a pilgrimage to Lumbini and erected a pillar at Buddha's birthplace, the inscriptions on which
                    mark the starting point for properly recorded history of Nepal.[47] Ashoka also visited the
                    Kathmandu valley and built monuments commemorating Gautama Buddha's visit there. By the 4th century
                    AD, much of Nepal was under the influence of the Gupta Empire.[f][48]

                    In the Kathmandu valley, the Kiratas were pushed eastward by the Licchavis, and the Licchavi dynasty
                    came into power c. 400 AD. The Lichchhavis built monuments and left a series of inscriptions;
                    Nepal's history of the period is pieced together almost entirely from them.[49][46] In 641, Songtsen
                    Gampo of the Tibetan Empire sends Narendradeva back to Licchavi with an army and subjugates Nepal.
                    Parts of Nepal and Licchavi was later under the direct influences of the Tibetan empire.[50] The
                    Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late 8th century and was followed by a Thakuri rule.
                    Thakuri kings ruled over the country up to the middle of the 11th century AD; not much is known of
                    this period that is often called the dark period.[51]</p>

                    possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian
                    subcontinent (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the
                    Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across the border.[39] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had
                    reached Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or
                    both.[40] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians,
                    who were in Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the
                    valley of Kathmandu.[41]


                    In the premises of the Changu Narayan Temple is a stone inscription dated 464 AD, the first in Nepal
                    since the Ashoka inscription of Lumbini (c. 250 BC).
                    By the late Vedic period, Nepal was being mentioned in various Hindu texts, such as the late Vedic
                    Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa and in the post-Vedic Atharvashirsha Upanishad.[42] The Gopal Bansa was the
                    oldest dynasty to be mentioned in various texts as the earliest rulers of the central Himalayan
                    kingdom known by the name 'Nepal'.[43] The Gopalas were followed by Kiratas who ruled for over 16
                    centuries by some accounts.[44] According to the Mahabharata, the then Kirata king went to take part
                    in the Battle of Kurukshetra. In the south-eastern region, Janakpurdham was the capital of the
                    prosperous kingdom of Videha or Mithila, that extended down to the Ganges, and home to King Janaka
                    and his daughter, Sita.

                    Around 600 BC, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of Nepal.
                    From one of these, the Shakya polity, arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an
                    ascetic life, founded Buddhism, and came to be known as Gautama Buddha (traditionally dated 563–483
                    BC).[45] Nepal came to be established as a land of spirituality and refuge in the intervening
                    centuries, played an important role in transmitting Buddhism to East Asia via Tibet,[46] and helped
                    preserve Hindu and Buddhist manuscripts.

                    By 250 BC, the southern regions had come under the influence of the Maurya Empire. Emperor Ashoka
                    made a pilgrimage to Lumbini and erected a pillar at Buddha's birthplace, the inscriptions on which
                    mark the starting point for properly recorded history of Nepal.[47] Ashoka also visited the
                    Kathmandu valley and built monuments commemorating Gautama Buddha's visit there. By the 4th century
                    AD, much of Nepal was under the influence of the Gupta Empire.[f][48]

                    In the Kathmandu valley, the Kiratas were pushed eastward by the Licchavis, and the Licchavi dynasty
                    came into power c. 400 AD. The Lichchhavis built monuments and left a series of inscriptions;
                    Nepal's history of the period is pieced together almost entirely from them.[49][46] In 641, Songtsen
                    Gampo of the Tibetan Empire sends Narendradeva back to Licchavi with an army and subjugates Nepal.
                    Parts of Nepal and Licchavi was later under the direct influences of the Tibetan empire.[50] The
                    Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late 8th century and was followed by a Thakuri rule.
                    Thakuri kings ruled over the country up to the middle of the 11th century AD; not much is known of
                    this period that is often called the dark period.[51]</p>
